It's me, Fito! 😄

My name is Santiago, I'm from Uruguay, besides surfing and travelling I'd also been passionate about building complex solutions of any type and form since I was a young boy. Everuthung started with the Legos box gifted by my older cousin. Nowadays I have the chance to channel that same curiosoty and mindset into building custom software products for our clients. I gathered my programming and architectural skills on 6 years of university and woking experience.  

- 🛎️ I'm currently working as part of the INIT.UY team for the last 3 years, boosting my freelance and startup experience. We achieved great goals together, willing to keep it like that.

    Thanks to INIT.UY I had the chance to work from startups building their MVPs to filling one seat at a robust organization's engineering team, for what I am gratfeul.

- 🎎 I’m looking to collaborate on some project related to the environmental crisis we are currently going though, as always seeking for a solution or at least do my part.

- 📚 I’m currently learning how to use AI to merge the data analysis world into the development process of an application.

- 📫 You can reach out to me though my work email at santiago.fitipaldo@init.uy for any inquiry or working proposal.

Never stop building!
