It's me, Fito! 😄

My name is Santiago, I'm from Uruguay, besides surfing and travelling I'd also been passionate about building complex solutions of any type since I was young. Everything started with the Legos box I had been gifted by my older cousin. Nowadays I have the chance to channel that same curiosoty and mindset into building custom software products for our clients. I gathered my programming and architectural skills on 6 years of university and woking experience.  

- 🛎️ I'd been part of the INIT.UY team for the last 3 years, learning not only clean code fundamentals but also how to create a product from scratch. We achieved great goals together, including several MVP developments, blockchain challenges faced mostly in Solana, and corporate microservices with loads of business logic and technical requirements. 

- 🎎 I’m looking to collaborate on some project related to the environmental crisis we are currently going though, as always seeking for a solution or at least do my part.

- 📚 I’m currently learning how to use AI to merge the data analysis world into the development process of an application.

- 📫 You can reach out to santiago.fitipaldo@init.uy for any inquiry or working proposal.
