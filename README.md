It's me, Fito! 😄

Enthusiastic Software Developer with a lifelong passion for creating and building since childhood. I am deeply dedicated to crafting remarkable products for clients by leveraging the most suitable technologies and robust architectural schemas. My journey as a developer has been fuelled by an unwavering curiosity, a commitment to innovation, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. Inspired by translating ideas into impactful solutions, I am driven to contribute my skills and dedication to delivering results for clients and end-users alike.

- 🛎️ I'd been part of the INIT.UY team for the last 3 years, learning not only clean code fundamentals, architectural overview and time management, but one remarkable thing was to learn the whole process to create a product from scratch. We achieved great goals together, including several MVP developments, blockchain challenges faced mostly in Solana, and corporate microservices with loads of business logic and technical requirements.

- 🎎 I’m looking to collaborate on some project related to the environmental crisis, I'd always wanted to contribute somehow to this cause and hopefully in the near future will find the opportunity.

- 📚 I’m currently learning how to use AI to merge the data analysis world into the development process of an application. But always seeking to learn more technologies and best practices.
