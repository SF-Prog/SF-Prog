It's me, Fito!

I am from Uruguay, I like surfing and travelling but also I'd been passionate about building complex solutions of any type since I was a young boy. Nowadays I had the chance to channel that into custom software development after I gathered my programming and architectural skills on both, University and woking experience.  

This is my personal account but you can also find some of my work at: https://github.com/sfitipaldo-classwallet.

- 🔭 I'm currently working as part of the INIT.UY team for the last 3 years, boosting my freelance and startup experience. We achieved great goals together, willing to keep it like that.

Thanks to INIT.UY I had the chance to work from startups building their MVPs to filling one seat at a robust organization's engineering team, for what I am gratfeul.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on some project related to the environmental crisis we are currently going though, as always seeking for a solution or at least do my part.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use AI to merge the data analysis world within the development process of an application.

- 📫 You can reach out to me though my work email at santiago.fitipaldo@init.uy for any inquiry or working proposal.

Never stop building!
