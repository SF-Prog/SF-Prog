It's me, Fito! 😄

 
Charging a lifelong passion for creating and building since childhood. I like crafting remarkable products for clients by leveraging the most suitable technologies and robust architectural solutions. My journey as a developer has been fuelled by an unwavering curiosity, commitment to innovation, and pursuit of excellence. Always felt inspired by translating ideas into effective solutions.

- 🛎️ I'd been part of the INIT.UY team for the last 4 years, learning clean code fundamentals, architectural overview and time management. We achieved great goals together, including MVP development, blockchain implementations (mostly on Solana's network), corporate microservices with loads of business logic, technical requirements and SCRUM compliance.

- 📚 I’m constantly learning, one of my favourite topics is blockchain related ususally.
