Welcome, I’m a software engineer from Montevideo, Uruguay. My passion is traveling, surfing, and exploring new cultures around the world.

I have carried a lifelong passion for creating and building things since childhood. Nowadays, I enjoy implementing remarkable products for end-users by leveraging the most suitable technologies and robust architectural solutions. My journey as a developer has been fueled by an unwavering curiosity, a commitment to innovation, and the pursuit of excellence. I’ve always been inspired to transform ideas into effective software solutions.
